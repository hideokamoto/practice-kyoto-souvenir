- You must save all of the screenshots to the test-results directory.
- This project uses Playwright for E2E testing (already installed in package.json).
- For E2E tests, use Playwright's built-in screenshot capabilities.
- For ad-hoc screenshots or browser automation outside of E2E tests, you may use the built-in browser or chrome dev tools mcp.
